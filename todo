√Wrong direction
√speed increase
√mushrooms initial
√mushrooms collide with centipede
√mushrooms degrade when shot
√why is everything especially head so jerky?
√stop the bullet when it hits something (mushroom)
√shot part turns into mushroom
√shooting mushrooms is weird because of the increased hit area thing...
xhave a way to cancel upcoming turn? might be why when it gets hit body parts get screwey
centipede intersecting centipede
keep spaceship on screen
keep spaceship below fold
tapping to shoot is weird -- add a button or make it always shoot
win state (all parts gone)
lose state (intersects ship)
splash screen
explosions
maybe have kids record sounds?
why is it killing the cpu?
